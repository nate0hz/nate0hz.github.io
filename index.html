					<h2>Getting Personal</h2>
					<p>Hi, Nate Picone here. I am the Service Delivery Lead for one of Australia and
						New Zealand’s leading beverage companies. In my spare time, I love learning
						Bahasa Indonesia, tinkering with lighting and Arduinos. I am slowly chipping
						away at building a smart home, staying away from commercial solutions as much
						as possible.</p>

							<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
							<p>My interest in IT ebbed and flowed in early life, but it began in my pre-teen
								years, with many weekends programming basic games on the family’s Commodore
								Vic-20. More substantial interest grew through high school as I discovered DOS
								but it was when I discovered some of the benefits that can come with networking
								and the internet, that my interest was truly sparked. Automation, machine
								learning and IOT are the areas that currently interest me the most.<br /><br />

								As I finished year 12, I could not decide on an field of study clearly enough to
								justify spending 4 years studying. Computer Science was a clear option, as were
								Law and Business. At the time, my priority was leaving Tasmania, which I managed
								by enrolling in a Melbourne TAFE. The enrolment was an excuse and as I was more
								enthusiastic about discovering big city life than I was about the course, I
								predictably dropped out. I had always intended to study in earnest at RMIT, due
								to its reputation and quality, and after many years of excuses, I have finally
								committed to a few single units.<br /><br />

								Initially I am completing a few introductory units as I want to get a feel
								for where technology is going. The emerging technologies and their applications
								are what interests me most, and introductory units tend to focus on wide and
								shallow coverage of many topics. I hope to test my preconceptions against the
								coverage of these fields, before settling on a field to pursue in depth.</p>

							<h3>Ideal job</h3>
							<p>I genuinely have my ideal job for right now. As Service Delivery Lead,
								I am able to combine my interest in technology, processes and well-honed
								understanding of user experience through the workings of the Service Desk.
								The entire point of this journey of learning, and possibly committing to a degree,
								is to seek out areas of interest for and to prepare for my next step.<br /><br />

								While I expect this to change as my knowledge grows, something along the lines of
								Cloud Operations Director (Seek 2020) appears in line with my interests.<br /><br />

								Remote work is being analysed by some organisations as a long term possibility
								(Ngyuen 2020) now that the onset of Coronavirus in 2020 has shown that it has not
								had a negative effect on productivity (Quiggin 2020) and that many workers desire
								the ability to work remotely for at least some of the time (Ziffer 2020). Even if
								remote working within Australia is not fully embraced, from my personal experience,
								I have witnessed some large multi-nationals embracing teams in various locations
								around the world providing services across the entire company, while others
								outsource international business partners to perform certain work, while wanting
								them to be well connected to the company. For this to be possible, Cloud solutions
								for application deployment are needed, such as Microsoft Azure, as are integrated
								communication and workspace tools, including solutions like Microsoft Teams,
								Sharepoint, Power BI, all of which are cloud based and able to help to analyse
								workflows and practices for improvement opportunities. Completing studies and
								working in a future focussed role or industry helps with future job security.<br /><br />

								This type of role requires innovative approaches to solving problems, and afford
								the opportunity to implement a solution that can remove inefficiencies or “baked-in,”
								legacy process issues, which aligns with my interests.<br /><br />

								As this is a senior position, leading implementing a score business strategy,
								well developed skills, experience and knowledge are critical. The advertisement
								describes a desire for 10 years or more experience in “progressively more experienced
								positions in Cloud Operations/DevOps roles” (Seek, 2020), indicating the
								organisation is seeking an individual who has developed over time. They also desire
								a person with “extensive experience” in AWS and/or Azure, along with other desirable
								traits and experience. <br /><br />

								Currently I lack much of the experience required for the role. I satisfy, to a
								lesser degree, transferrable skills, like management and continuous improvement,
								but the technical knowledge and the implementation of the technical knowledge are
								areas I do not yet have experience in. <br /><br/>

								Learning key Azure skills can begin with Microsoft’s own online courses (Microsoft
								2020), and furthered through professional courses, operated by local training organisations,
								such as DDLS (DDLS 2020). AWS offer similar training packages for students (AWS 2020).
								I believe the best path for me to move into a role like this is to leverage both the
								opportunities at my employer and my studies to assist the cloud solutions team, working
								on projects to further grow skills and knowledge. That experience can then be used
								to apply for dedicated project or architect roles and in turn demonstrate a
								history of “progressively more experienced positions.” (Seek 2020).</p>

							<h3>Personal Profile</h3>
							<h4>Myers Briggs</H4>
								<p>The 16personalities.com Myers-Briggs test places me as INFJ-T, and you can view my
									profile <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/cf89536fdbc6f">here.</a></p>
							<br />
							<h4>Learning Style</H4>
								<p>Personality Max places my learning style at largely Visual and Auditory at similar
									levels, and to a lesser extent Kinesthetic. You can view my report <a href="https://personalitymax.com/report/?ls=72-69-49&name_key=a5f6e6955e">here.</a></p>
						  <h4>Burnout Self-Test</h4>
							  <p>Out of curiosity, I took mindtools.com Burnout Self Test,
									<a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_08.htm">here,</a> where I was
									asked a series of questions about my frustration and irritability levels at work. With
									a score of 29, the test rated me as “Little sign of burnout here, unless some factors
									are particularly severe.” (Mindtools 2020)</p>
							<h4>The results</h4>
							<p>The results of these tests are largely not surprising, although I was surprised to learn
							how much I lean toward “turmoil,” and away from assertive in the Myers-Briggs test. This
							has prompted me to keep this in mind when dealing with others, and will develop my
							assertiveness further. My leadership style has tended toward consultative and fostering
							but when articulating a position, I can be quite clear about my opinion.<br /><br />

							A key point here, within teams, is that I can tend to not have my voice heard, so I would
							do well to make it clear to others that any lack of apparent assertiveness is not indecision.</p>

										<h3>Project</h3>
										<p>My proposed project is to maintain a live database of items in my fridge, which can
											be accessed anywhere on my mobile, so I can see what I have and what I need, while at the
											supermarket. Favourite and essential items that are out of stock, or low in stock, will be
											flagged and listed first, so the user can easily determine what items need to be purchased.<br /><br />

											The project uses a webcam, connected to a Raspberry Pi, to capture images of the items,
											and object recognition would interpret the image to add entries to or remove them from
											the database on purchase or use, respectively. The database would instantly upload the
											refreshed database to an almost live webpage.<br /><br />

											The motivation here is that I am terrible at making shopping lists and even worse at remembering the
											items I need to buy when at the supermarket, which is evidenced by my cupboard holding five litres of
											shampoo, yet I can never remember to buy ginger. Clearly I am not alone here, as Samsung has released a
											Family Hub Fridge, which puts cameras inside the fridge, to give a live view of the fridge’s contents
											(Samsung 2020), and several enthusiastic Pi users have followed with their various versions (Horne 2016).<br /><br/>

											While many who have tackled this problem are aligned with Samsung’s thoughts of offering live or static
											images (mikeandlauren n.d), and one project suggested using load sensors to measure an item’s weight
											(aeckard87 2013), the proposed approach would overcome some problems with existing solutions, such as
											the camera’s restrictions of only being able to see the items at the front of shelves, or having to
											install and set up multiple, relatively expensive (Amazon n.d.) load sensors throughout the fridge.<br /><br />

											The bill of materials for the solution is short, and would be built from items mostly already found at
											home, including:
											<ul>
												<li> A high definition web camera (already owned)</li>
												<li> A Raspberry Pi 4B (already owned)</li>
												<li> A monitor, for observing the object recognition success from tensor flow, during prototyping
													and could later be replaced with a mobile device (already owned)</li>
												<li> <a href="(https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/object_detection/overview)"> Google TensorFlow</a>, to allow for object recognition</li>
												<li> Possibly software to scan and read barcodes for packaged items (several suggestions on the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=225499">
													Raspberry Pi Forum)</a></li>
												<li> An undetermined , simple database to store the inventory (several possibilities in <a href="https://github.com/SensorsIot/IOTstack">IOT Stack)</a></li>
												<li> Undetermined, simple web hosting software, so that the webpage can be hosted on the Pi (again,
													bundled in <a href="https://github.com/SensorsIot/IOTstack">IOTStack)</a></li>
												<li> A three or four button module, for user input and to change modes <a href="https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/4-Button-Module-for-Arduino-/154007412045">(something like this)</a></li>
												<li> <a href="https://www.python.org/"> Python</a> to write a simple program to detect and action the
													input from the button module </li>
												</ul>

													The current concept is that the device would be installed in the kitchen, with the camera pointing
														at an area on the bench. On returning home from grocery shopping, the user would place some items in
														the scanning space, wait for tensor flow to recognise the objects and quantities, then press a button
														to initiate the Python script and append the items to the inventory. When the user wishes to use an
														item from the fridge, they would place it in the scanning area, wait for TensorFlow to recognise the
														object and press another button, removing it from the inventory. As the inventory is adjusted, the
														database is uploaded to the hosted web page in real time.<br /><br />

													Multiple new skills will be required for this project, including:
													<ul>
														<li> Enabling the web camera to function and capture imaged with the Raspberry Pi</li>
														<li> Writing a TensorFlow model</li>
														<li> Training the model to recognise select objects</li>
														<li> Determining how to get the object recognised by TensorFlow into the database</li>
														<li> Programming the buttons and their actions, and interfacing those with the other applications</li>
														<li> Writing the code to enable a regularly refreshing web page, drawing data from a database</li>
														<li> Installing and setting up web hosting software.</li>
													</ul>
													As I wrote the list I started to realise the scale of the new skills required for this project, and while
													feasible to create, due to time constraints, it is unlikely it will be completed within this course.<br /><br />

													However, when it is completed, the project will enable my household to know exactly what is in the fridge
													at any time. This will greatly assist in efficient shopping, but can also assist with meal planning without
													needing to be physically in front of the fridge, when deciding what to cook with ingredients already in our possession.</p>
